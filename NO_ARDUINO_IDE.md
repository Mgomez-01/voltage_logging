# 🚀 ESP8266 Voltage Logger - No Arduino IDE Required!

You absolutely don't need Arduino IDE! I've set up the project to work with multiple professional development tools.

## **📁 Current Project Structure**

## **🎯 Recommended Approach: PlatformIO**

**Why PlatformIO over Arduino IDE?**
- ✅ Professional development environment
- ✅ Better library dependency management
- ✅ Faster compilation and uploads
- ✅ Command-line friendly (great for automation)
- ✅ Works with VS Code, CLion, or command-line
- ✅ Better debugging and monitoring tools
- ✅ Git-friendly project structure

## **⚡ Quick Setup (2 minutes)**

### **Method 1: PlatformIO + VS Code (Most Popular)**
```bash
# Install VS Code if you don't have it
# Install "PlatformIO IDE" extension in VS Code
# Open the voltage_logger folder in VS Code
# Click the PlatformIO build/upload buttons
```

### **Method 2: PlatformIO Command Line**
```bash
# Install PlatformIO
pip install platformio

# Navigate to project
cd voltage_logger

# Build and upload
pio run --target upload

# Monitor serial output  
pio device monitor
```

### **Method 3: Using Make (if you prefer make)**
```bash
# Install PlatformIO first
pip install platformio

# Then use simple make commands
make deploy    # Build, upload, and monitor in one command
make build     # Just compile
make upload    # Upload to ESP8266
make monitor   # Serial monitor
```

## **🔧 What's Different from Arduino IDE?**

| Arduino IDE | PlatformIO |
|-------------|------------|
| .ino files | .cpp files (same code, different extension) |
| GUI-based library manager | `platformio.ini` config file |
| Manual library installation | Automatic dependency resolution |
| Basic serial monitor | Advanced monitoring with filters |
| Single environment | Multiple build environments |

## **📝 Your Code is Ready**

The ESP8266 code in `src/main.cpp` is identical to what would work in Arduino IDE, just with `.cpp` extension instead of `.ino`. All the same Arduino functions work:
- `setup()` and `loop()`
- `WiFi.begin()`, `analogRead()`, etc.
- Same libraries: ESP8266WiFi, WebSocketsServer, ArduinoJson

## **🚀 Deploy Your Voltage Logger**

Choose your preferred method:

### **Option A: VS Code + PlatformIO (Recommended)**
1. Install VS Code
2. Install "PlatformIO IDE" extension  
3. Open `voltage_logger` folder
4. Click the upload button (→) in PlatformIO toolbar
5. Click monitor button to see serial output

### **Option B: Command Line**
```bash
pip install platformio
cd voltage_logger
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

### **Option C: Make Commands**
```bash
pip install platformio
cd voltage_logger
make deploy  # Does everything: build, upload, monitor
```

## **🎯 Why This is Better**

- **Faster Development**: No GUI delays, faster compilation
- **Better Error Messages**: More detailed compiler output
- **Professional Tools**: Same tools used by ESP32/ESP8266 professionals
- **Version Control**: Project files work great with git
- **Automation Friendly**: Easy to integrate with CI/CD if needed
- **Multiple Environments**: Can easily target different ESP8266 boards

## **🔧 Still Want Arduino IDE?**

If you prefer Arduino IDE, you can still use it:
1. Copy `src/main.cpp` to `voltage_logger.ino`  
2. Install libraries manually: WebSocketsServer, ArduinoJson
3. Upload as usual

But I strongly recommend trying PlatformIO - it's a much better development experience once you get used to it!
